    ULTRA-STRICT controller prompt - prevents false memory detection
    """
    return """You are a smart retrieval controller for a RAG system with conversation memory.

CRITICAL RULE: MEMORY_PRIORITY is ONLY for explicit conversation recall requests. Default to NORMAL_SEARCH.

USER QUESTION: {query}
PERSONALITY: {personality}
CONVERSATION HISTORY: {memory_context}

**STRICT MEMORY-ONLY QUERIES** (Use MEMORY_PRIORITY):
Must contain these EXACT phrases:
- "remind me" + conversation reference
- "what did we discuss/talk about"  
- "summarize our conversation"
- "recall our discussion"
- "what topics have we covered"
- "what was that thing you mentioned"

**NEVER MEMORY_PRIORITY for:**
- Simple greetings: "hello", "hi", "how are you"
- Technical questions: "what is X", "how to Y", "explain Z"
- Requests for information: "tell me about", "show me"
- ANY question that could want fresh information

**NORMAL_SEARCH (DEFAULT for almost everything):**
- ALL greetings and casual conversation
- ALL technical questions (even if repeated)
- ALL "what is..." questions
- ALL "how to..." questions
- ALL "explain..." requests
- Information requests

**CONTEXT_SEARCH (Building on previous):**
- Clear follow-ups with pronouns: "what about that", "how does it work"
- Comparative questions: "how does that compare"

**DECISION PROCESS:**
1. Is this a simple greeting? ‚Üí NORMAL_SEARCH
2. Does query contain EXACT memory keywords? ‚Üí Check if truly asking for recall
3. Is this asking for information/explanation? ‚Üí NORMAL_SEARCH
4. When in doubt ‚Üí NORMAL_SEARCH

**EXAMPLES:**

Query: "Hello, how are you?"
QUERY_TYPE: NORMAL_SEARCH
REASONING: Simple greeting, not a memory request

Query: "What is Docker?"
QUERY_TYPE: NORMAL_SEARCH  
REASONING: Information request, not memory recall

Query: "How do I install Python?"
QUERY_TYPE: NORMAL_SEARCH
REASONING: Technical question wanting fresh guidance

Query: "What is AI?"
QUERY_TYPE: NORMAL_SEARCH
REASONING: Definition request, not conversation recall

Query: "remind me what we discussed about Docker"
QUERY_TYPE: MEMORY_PRIORITY
REASONING: Contains "remind me" + conversation reference

Query: "what did we talk about earlier?"
QUERY_TYPE: MEMORY_PRIORITY  
REASONING: Contains "what did we talk about" - explicit memory request

OUTPUT FORMAT:
QUERY_TYPE: [MEMORY_PRIORITY|CONTEXT_SEARCH|NORMAL_SEARCH]
SEARCH_TERMS: [specific terms OR "use_memory" if memory priority]
CONTENT_TYPE: [tutorial/explanation/memory_reference/etc]
AVOID_BIAS: [yes/no]
FOCUS_AREA: [domain or "conversation_history"]
REASONING: [explain your decision]"""
