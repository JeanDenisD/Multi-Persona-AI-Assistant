## 🎤 **ADVANCED VOICE SYSTEM**

### **Speech-to-Text (STT) Architecture:**

#### **Primary STT Service: ElevenLabs**

```python
# ElevenLabs STT with scribe_v1 model
client.speech_to_text.convert(
    file=audio_buffer,
    model_id="scribe_v1",
    language_code="eng"
)
```

#### **Fallback STT Service: OpenAI Whisper**

```python
# Automatic fallback on ElevenLabs errors
client.audio.transcriptions.create(
    model="whisper-1",
    file=audio_buffer,
    response_format="text"
)
```

#### **Smart Fallback Logic:**

```
ElevenLabs STT → [Success] → Return transcription
                ↓ [Fail: Rate limit/Error]
            Whisper STT → [Success] → Return transcription
                        ↓ [Fail]
                    "Speech recognition failed"
```

### **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Architecture:**

#### **Personality Voice Mapping:**

```python
personality_voices = {
    "networkchuck": "energetic_male_voice_id",     # Tech enthusiasm
    "bloomy": "professional_female_voice_id",      # Financial expertise
    "ethicalhacker": "focused_female_voice_id",    # Security mindset
    "patientteacher": "gentle_female_voice_id",    # Educational approach
    "startupfounder": "confident_male_voice_id",   # Business leadership
    "datascientist": "analytical_female_voice_id"  # Data-driven insights
}
```

#### **TTS Generation Process:**

```
AI Response Text → Personality Detection → Voice ID Mapping → ElevenLabs TTS → Audio Generation → Voice Playback
```

### **Voice Integration Performance:**

- ✅ **Reliable STT**: ElevenLabs primary + Whisper fallback ensures 99%+ uptime
- ✅ **Quality TTS**: 6 distinct personality voices with ElevenLabs quality
