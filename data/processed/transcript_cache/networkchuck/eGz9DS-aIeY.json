  "text": " Hey, do you want to see me build a docker container? Yeah, let's do it real quick. Done. Want to see it again? Done. Man, that was fast. Docker containers. If you're in it, you got to know it. If you want to learn cloud, azure, AWS, Google, linode, devops, networking systems, I think I said everything right. So I hope you have your coffee ready. In this video, we're covering three things. First, what the junk is Docker to you're getting hands on with Docker. I'm giving you access to a free lab. Thanks to the sponsor of this video, Linode. And then three, we'll go a bit deeper, talk about the big why, why Docker. All right, let's do it. Okay, what the junk is a Docker container? Whoa, whoa, whoa, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. Before we can define what a Docker container is, we have to first define what it's replacing virtual machines. What is a virtual machine? How many of you already know, check the timestamps to jump forward, but we're going to cover what it is real quick. And I actually have a ton of virtual machines running on servers in my data center right now. And I've been meaning to get those servers out of there, except I'm paying a high bill. I want to bring those home with me right now. Let's go get it. Who's things should I unplug? Goodbye, data center. So here's one of my babies. My servers. Now, before we answer the question, what in the world is a Docker container? We have to first talk about what's a virtual machine? Let's dig in. So this is my server. Traditionally, before virtual machines, you would install one operating system on this piece of hardware. Oh, it dusty. All of the servers resources from the CPU to the RAM to the hard drive, all of it was dedicated to one operating system, one server OS. So like I might just have Linux, and this is my Linux server, or I might just have Windows. This would be my Windows server 2016. Now, what's the issue with that? Well, none really, unless you want another server, another operating system. So before virtual machines, if you wanted a Windows server and a Linux server, you had to have two physical servers like this. So that's where virtualization comes in. Instead of installing one operating system, we're going to install something called a hypervisor. Now, a hypervisor is kind of like an operating system, but it only has one goal. Its goal is to help you carve up or divide your server's resources into multiple servers. Now, there are a ton of hypervisors, but the most popular one would be the Mware, which is what I have installed in my servers. And specifically, it's called ESXI bonus points. If you tell me in the comments what this means, or what it stands for, and simply what it allows us to do is take a portion of our servers resources, maybe two gigs of RAM, two CPUs, 100 gigabytes of hardware drive space, and this will be our Ubuntu server. And then on the same server I could say over here, I can have one CPU, not cup, one CPU, two gigs of RAM, 40 gigs of hard drive space. And that will be my Windows server 2016. And I can keep doing this until my server runs out of resources, or I can even make these bigger, going from, I don't know, one CPU to 41. I mean, you can go crazy. Virtual machines are amazing, and people use them every single day. But that's not how Docker works. In fact, Docker is kind of, well, not just kind of, it's different. When we use Docker containers, it takes us back to before virtualization. We're going to install one operating system on this entire thing. So one operating system gets access to everything our server has to offer. But why do that? That's the big question, right? What is Docker doing? Here's what it is. And this is crazy. I'm going to drop this line on you, okay? Where virtualization and virtual machines are virtualizing hardware. Docker virtualizes the operating system. What? What does that even mean? Now, that's right here is what we commonly see when we visualize how virtualization works. We have our hardware, we've got our, our hypervisor, and then we have our guest operating systems. But let me show you what Docker looks like. We'll always have our hardware, but instead of a hypervisor, like we just discussed, we're going to have one operating system installed on top of this hardware, or onto the hardware. And let's just say for our case, we are going to install Ubuntu. Now, here we go. We'll then have our good old buddy Docker fly in and make some magic happen. Docker installs like any other application you might install on Linux, it'll be a process running or a daemon running. And then using Docker, we will virtualize portions of our operating system. In this case, Ubuntu to create containers, which by the way, we'll define here in a moment, but they're really doing the same thing as these virtual machines over here. They have the same function and they have a lot of the same qualities, which is why it's kind of cool how they can replace virtual machines controversial, but that's what I think. And these containers, much like VMs, can be running a different operating system, CentOS and even Ubuntu, you can install Ubuntu on Ubuntu. What? Okay, but what are these things? What are containers? I like to think of them as crazy fast, lightweight micro computers, and don't let micro fool you like they're they can be as powerful as you want them to be. And similar to a virtual machine, they'll have their own operating system, their own CPU processes, their own memory, their own network. And the most important thing, and I think it's really appropriate for nowadays, is that they're quarantined, they are isolated, they are secure. As far as they understand, they are their own thing. They might as well be installed on very metal servers, because that's how isolated they are. Wilson, they're as isolated as you are right now. What, too soon? Now let me say it again, these suckers are lightweight and they are wicked fast. Like you saw at the beginning of this video, click bam, it's there. Now we'll cover why they're more lightweight, why they're faster and more of why they're amazing here in a moment. But I think it's time. I think it's time you got your hands dirty, your feet wet, all those things, we're going to do that right now time to get your hands on with Docker containers. I'm so excited about this. You might say I can't contain myself. Sorry. Okay, here we go. Fire up your web browser, go to the link below linode.com forward slash network. Chuck. And you get $20 of free credit more than enough to play with Docker. So go ahead and create that free account and we will start labbing right now. Now, as I mentioned before, Linode is a cloud service provider, very similar to AWS, Azure, Google, and we're going to use them as our cloud service provider right now. So from the dashboard, we'll go to the top right and click on create. And we'll create a Linode. Now right now you should be on distributions. I want you to click on one click, click on that. And this is what's really cool about this. Look at all these pre built apps you can just deploy in the cloud WordPress, open VPN, run your own VPN server in the cloud Minecraft. Okay, cool. CS go. I kind of want to do this now. Anyways, the one we want to look at now is obviously Docker. Bam, I'll select Docker. Now you can install and run Docker anywhere windows Linux, you can install on a virtual machine. But this is great because it makes it easy. Docker is already ready to go. I'll just click create. I'll select my size 10 bucks a month. Hey, that's half of what you are getting for free right now. I'll name it my frigging sweet Docker lab, and then a root password for your root user. And then click create. Ah, forgot my region. I'm in Dallas. That way get super fast performance. Go. Now this is essentially creating a virtual machine for you in a Leno cloud. And it's pre baked with Docker. And once yours is ready, click on launch console at the very top here. And right here in the browser, you have access as soon as it's done doing your updates. But if you're like me, like to use your own terminal, more of a homie feel. So I'll grab the public IP address right here. Copy that and open up my own which is solar putty. I highly recommend solar putty you should use it. Go download it now link below. It's free. And I will connect your name root and the password is what I just set. And I'm in I'll clear this out. I've got my own ready to run Docker empire. Yeah, I caught that. So for this lab, we're going to do three things. We're going to install CentOS, we're going to install Alpine and a third mystery thing which makes Docker the coolest thing ever. So hang tight. But let's do let's do CentOS first. First I need the image so I'll do Docker pull CentOS. What this is doing is it's going out to the Docker hub, which is a registry of Docker images. These images are what we use to run or create our containers. I'll show you real quick. So we'll go ahead and pull the image for CentOS. It'll go out and find it and download it. Bam, we've got it. So now with that CentOS image, we're going to run our first Docker container. So it'll be the command Docker run, we're going to use a few switches dash D and dash T, we'll do dash dash name to name this container on a mine can't contain myself. Name yours whatever you want. And then at the end, I'll specify the image I want to use, which is the one we just pulled down CentOS. And this is how fast Docker containers are created and run. It's running that that was it. A virtual machine booting a virtual machine takes a whole lot longer than that. That's crazy. So let's make sure it's running. We'll use command Docker PS to see our running Docker containers. There she is. And she's so pretty. Look at her. That is CentOS isolated, secure, running with its own operating system CPU memory network. Oh, it's quarantined. But let's, um, let's walk into the room real quick. We can connect to CentOS and start playing around with it by using the command Docker exec, I'll use the switch dash it and then I'll reference the name we named it. So it was can't contain myself for me if I spell it right. And then after the name I'll specify I want to connect to the bash shell. Boom. And I'm in CentOS. I am in a container. And look, I mean, it even has its own file system, like it's completely separate to get out of there. We'll just do a quick type in exit. And we're back home. And you'll know where you are. If you pay attention to root at blah, blah, blah. That's the container ID. We were just in CentOS. Over here is my Docker machine here. So I'm going to clear my screen. Let's do another one. We'll do Docker pull. Let's say we pull down Alpine, a very popular Linux distribution, because it's very, very lightweight, especially for Docker. See, I mean, it pulled it down so quickly. And we'll do Docker run dash t dash d, I'll name this oh yeah. And then the image name was Alpine. Boom. Another one started if I do Docker PS to containers running. Awesome. Let's connect to it. Docker exec. Dash it. Oh yeah. And then Alpine I'll just connect to the shell. So I'll type in sh. And boom, I'm there. I'm an Alpine, a separate operating system, a separate container, quarantine. It's so cool. You know what, you can do this too. If you want, I'm going to install a whole bunch of things right now. Okay, so now if I do Docker PS, I got a few things going on. I've got three different flavors of Ubuntu running right now, 16, 14 and 18 on the same server. That's amazing. WordPress. It's, it's, it's cool. Now for number three. And I want you to do this with me. This is actually a Docker image that I created a while back for my Azure course on CBT nuggets. If you want to check that course out link below. But using this image, I want to demonstrate the power, the amazingness. Is that a word? Yes, it is now of Docker. Let's do it real quick. So first, I want you to pull down my image. Now to find it, let's go to Docker hub. It's hub dot Docker.com. This is a registry where you can download and pull all these images from Docker. And they have a ton of stuff on some of the stuff they have is from me. So you type in network chuck in the search bar, I come up here and actually have two out there. I don't know if the other ones for but the one I want you to click on is coffee based training has 879 downloads. That's pretty cool. Jump in there and even shows you like the command you can use to pull down this image. Now don't use that just yet. I want you to copy the network chuck port slash NC coffee. And we're going to use the tag French press and I'll show you how to use a tag right now. So the command will be Docker pull. I'll paste in my name here, the network Chucky Chucky the network Chuck port slash NC coffee and then colon French press. The tag basically gives us the ability to download different versions of a particular image. I did that with Ubuntu just earlier I could specify the tag 1617 whatever and download different versions. So I'm going to pull down my image. Boom, it's ready. Now I'm going to run it clear things out here. So I'll do Docker run dash t dash D and then one more switch here dash P which sends reports. And we're going to map port 80 which is a port for a website obviously we'll map that from our Docker container to our host. And for any exam people out there here are studying for the DevNet associate or CCNA the port right here at the end is for the Docker container and the port right here is for the host. So I'm essentially saying match port 80 to port 80. Then I'll name my guy name it NC coffee. And then I'll specify the image which is the network Chuck port slash NC coffee and then colon French press and it'll be quick done. I'll do Docker PS. It's running. Now here's what I want you to do if you go back to your Linode dashboard here grab the IP address once more copy it and then just plug that into your browser go to it. It's a Docker container running my website I made obviously it's a professionally designed website click on the link it'll take you to CBT nuggets I mean it's it's top notch if you want to hire me for web development I'm available. Now let me ask you a question did you set up this website did you alter any settings install any programs did you put in this like did you do any of this no but if you pulled down that image and ran that container like I just demonstrated you have a website that looks just like this you see that container not only has its own OS CPU processes memory but it also has all the settings I applied my website configuration all the prerequisites all the dependencies packaged together and a neat little package a container no need to mess with it it's perfect and you can move that sucker to any computer any Linux based machine and it runs like a champ I can move this same Docker container to AWS to Azure to your computer to my computer to wherever and it's going to run the same and that's the power of Docker so everything from the OS which is Debbie and Linux to the things I had to install to make it work Ingenix which is a web server software and then all the website files that I used which you can tell by the quality of the site took a lot of stuff and then anything else I might need all dependencies packaged into a nice neat container that can run anywhere and now we're at number three of our objective kind of talking about the big why why why docker containers why are they so killer compared to virtual machines and really why should you care about them we've seen a few of the things like they're lightweight and they're fast and we just saw what I think is one of the coolest things about it is that they're portable no matter where they run they run another example of why this is absolutely killer is like look here I've got different flavors of Ubuntu I might have apps that aren't compatible to run on a certain version of Ubuntu oh and by the way before we go any further if you want to stop any of these containers you can do that here just do stop docker stop and then the container name so I'll drop like one of my uh I'll drop alpine oh yeah and then I can start them right back up again docker start oh yeah and bam he's up again and if you want to like see how much CPU they're using memory network we can do docker stats and we get this cool I mean I think it's cool view of all that's going on real time and they control C to back out of there oh and this is for all of you who told me to try out arch Linux I can install as a docker container as well and boom just like that I'm running arch Linux okay at this point we've learned a bit about docker containers we've even created a few and played around with the command line that that was fun now we're gonna go just a little bit deeper not too deep because we we don't have the time but we'll talk about okay why is it so fast why is it so lightweight and how is the industry using it right now this will be real quick let's talk about it so first of all why is it so fast how does it boot up so fast how do we create containers so quickly what's the voodoo behind that the short answer is that you only need one kernel notice that over here when I'm demonstrating docker all of these os's are Linux based they all share the underlying Linux kernel just like ubuntu does so ubuntu when we installed him he's running off the Linux kernel and it's the same Linux kernel that all of these os's right here would use so this part of the os is already up and running and that's in stark contrast over here on a virtual machine you see each of these os's have their own Linux kernel they're spinning up I'll just put okay for the rest because they are virtual machines and every time you deploy a new virtual machine that's another Linux kernel and then the operating system and that steps into the other part is their lightweight why are they lightweight because we don't need more than one Linux kernel you see these virtual machines to run more than one os and to have this app isolation like we want to with containers we have to have a guest operating system every time which involves another kernel it involves a hypervisor which is also kind of heavy so it's overall just heavy there are more parts and pieces that have to be running to make that work whereas a container is much more simple lightweight and fast now one thing I want you to note and you probably noticed this I have a windows server over here but I didn't install windows server over here on Linux you can't do that containers are available docker you can install on windows based systems windows 10 windows server I believe 2016 and up but you can only install windows based containers on a windows system same goes for Linux you can only install Linux based containers on a Linux system because they share the same underlying os or kernel and yeah docker on windows is cool you can install docker containers on windows and it shares the same qualities as a Linux docker container they're isolated they have their own processes and memory and network it's it's just as cool now what I've given here was a very high level overview we didn't go very deep at all docker is a big thing like there's there's an entire docker certification it's it's huge and if you want to learn more go deeper because there's a lot more maybe you want to learn more about how containers work maybe you want to learn hey like they're using control groups which are defining how much cpu how much memory how much os resources that you're giving each docker container and then how they're segmenting it isolated isolating everything with namespaces and by the way these two concepts that can be attributed to containers have been around for a long time containers have been a thing for a very very long time docker isn't the only type of one either so it's it's a whole big thing so if you want to dive deeper if you want to create your own docker containers there's a great course from Sean Powers at CBT nuggets link below and if you want to learn more just about the behind the scenes and under the hood I link some books and stuff below as well now the last thing I wanted to mention is how is the industry using docker well we already demonstrated that we could put a docker container up in the cloud linode we just did that you can move that same docker container to azure to aws they have the same sort of situation with docker it's just like a web app you deploy and you can launch your containers this is killer for developers because they can write their code deploy it in a docker container and know that it works everywhere and that's a problem with developers that they've had for a long time is that they'll write an app on their computer and it works great they spent time polishing it you know dot in their eyes and all kinds of stuff and then that same code is run by I don't know a tester and it doesn't work and the developers like well hey it worked on my machine I don't know what you're doing no more of that junk no more of that because if you deploy it in a docker container everything that app needs is right there in its container it's containing it's isolated and finally the last thing that is kind of taken the industry by storm is the concept of microservices this is more for developers but as a person who's in it and as you move into more dev opt stuff this is stuff you'll understand and have to work with microservices involves taking portions of your application your stack and and segmenting it into smaller bits and pieces so traditionally you might have you know one server where you install your entire application everything you need so for example wordpress you might install your wordpress server and your your mysql sequel database on the same box and that's traditionally what developers might have done is they would install as many compatible apps as they could on one server but now with containers they can take one app in particular like maybe just the wordpress server and have that in one container and then maybe take the mysql portion and have that in one container so they're isolated there's no conflicting things and when you want to update one portion of your app you're just updating one container and that's a whole other topic for a discussion a whole big world it's fun it's exciting and i'm hoping that this video got you started on docker and it won't be your end point i hope you go further with this and you know let me know if you want me to make more videos about docker well that's about it docker is a big thing and i hope you uh be a fun watching this video let me know what you thought in the comments and also let me know how you're gonna use docker i mean there's a variety of ways like for example in my own home i have docker running on my technology server and i have a container that's running home assistant which is a home automation framework i guess it's really cool you can also run things like piehole and just a ton of stuff it's it's it's amazing what you can do not to mention that if you're learning linux you want to try out all kinds of different linux distributions you saw how easy it was to set up that lab oh my goodness it's so powerful who i've been talking too much so if you haven't already hit that subscribe button if you like what i'm doing here and hit that notification bell to always get notifications when i go live or when i have new videos and also don't forget to support the sponsor of this video linode if you want to deploy a website or an app or just a minecraft server uh link below get 20 credit so if you didn't get a chance to lab do it now i'll catch you guys later",
