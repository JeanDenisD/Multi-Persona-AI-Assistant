13,125.8,133.4,7.6000000000000085,before and the Benford's law here is exactly the same formula as discussed before and now,ifP0EFbZ5xI,Benford's law example in Excel (4 minutes),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifP0EFbZ5xI,bloomy,finance_excel,ExplainHowToSimply,20210820,en,242,"bloomberg,excel,finance,data analysis,trading,financial modeling"
14,133.44,142.92000000000002,9.480000000000018,actually when we look at the counts of the leading digits we have here just the count if we have,ifP0EFbZ5xI,Benford's law example in Excel (4 minutes),https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifP0EFbZ5xI,bloomy,finance_excel,ExplainHowToSimply,20210820,en,242,"bloomberg,excel,finance,data analysis,trading,financial modeling"
15,142.92000000000002,157.32,14.399999999999977,the leading digit within column D.

38,243.28,249.76,6.47999999999999,the Bloomberg terminal to retrieve data through a python script and second the Bloomberg excel,TnQuWrcDLzc,Historical constituents matrix of equity index with Python Jupiter Notebook from Bloomberg Terminal,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnQuWrcDLzc,bloomy,finance_excel,ExplainHowToSimply,20231030,en,1901,"bloomberg,excel,finance,data analysis,trading,financial modeling"
39,249.76,256.4,6.639999999999986,add-in is also required. So in the first step we are going to import the required packages. First,TnQuWrcDLzc,Historical constituents matrix of equity index with Python Jupiter Notebook from Bloomberg Terminal,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnQuWrcDLzc,bloomy,finance_excel,ExplainHowToSimply,20231030,en,1901,"bloomberg,excel,finance,data analysis,trading,financial modeling"
